Risk Odds Calculator
by Ryan Williams (ryan.blake.williams@gmail.com)

Given the an attacking force of size <A> and a defending force of size <D>, this utility computes a variety of probabilities related to the scenario where, in a game of Risk, an attacking force of size <A> attacks a defending force of size <D>, each side always rolls the maximum possible number of dice, and the attacker fights all the way to the last man.

Usage:
$ ./risk <attacking_force> <defending_force>

Example:

# Sample outcome of a rather large battle
$ ./risk 20 10

When 20 armies attack 10:

	Probability of winning:

		Attacker: 0.965
		Defender: 0.035

	Expected losses:

		Attacker: 8.267
		Defender: 9.900

	Probabilities of various outcomes:
